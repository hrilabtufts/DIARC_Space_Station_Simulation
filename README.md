# DIARC Unity Space Station Simulation

This repository contains the DIARC space station simulation comprised of two release executables and a Python script for launching the docker containers and services required to simulate a PR2 running DIARC.

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repo
1. Download the [Unity space station server](https://github.com/hrilabtufts/DIARC_Space_Station_Simulation/releases/download/linux_server/Space_Station_SMM_Server_3.6.6_Linux.zip) (Linux) or alternate [Windows build](https://github.com/hrilabtufts/DIARC_Space_Station_Simulation/releases/download/linux_server/Space_Station_SMM_Server_3.6.6_Windows.zip)
1. Download the [Unity space station client](https://github.com/hrilabtufts/DIARC_Space_Station_Simulation/releases/download/linux_server/Space_Station_SMM_Client_5.6.23_Windows.zip) (Windows)
1. Create your [.env configuration](#script-config)
1. Create your [Unity configuration files](#unity-config)
1. Build the docker image with `python launch.py build`
1. Start the docker container with `python launch.py run`
1. When ROS has started, the Unity server will launch unless otherwise specified
1. When the Unity server and DIARC have completed launching, start the client

### Unity Server

The server build connects to the virtual PR2 via RosBridge and DIARC. 
It allows one or more client to connect to it and interact with the robot.

This requires a `server_settings.json` file in the `StreamingAssets` directory of the build.
See [Configuring Unity Space Station Server](#server-config) for more information.

* [Space Station Server v3.6.6 - Latest](https://github.com/hrilabtufts/DIARC_Space_Station_Simulation/releases/download/linux_server/Space_Station_SMM_Server_3.6.6_Linux.zip)

### Unity Client

The client build connects to the Unity server and provides the user interaction. 
When using a[Vive Pro Eye](https://www.vive.com/sea/product/vive-pro-eye/overview/) and with the [SRanipal](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/hardware/VIVE/sranipal) eye tracking software installed, user eye gaze and pupil size will be tracked by the application.

This requires a `client_settings.json` file in the `StreamingAssets` directory of the build.
See [Configuring Unity Space Station Client](#client-config) for more information.

* [Space Station Client v5.6.23 - Latest](https://github.com/hrilabtufts/DIARC_Space_Station_Simulation/releases/download/linux_server/Space_Station_SMM_Client_5.6.23_Windows.zip)

### LSL - LabRecorder

Syncing the clock data between the Unity server and client is handled by [Lab Streaming Layer](https://labstreaminglayer.org/).
Install the [LabRecorder](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-LabRecorder) and start it after both the Unity server and client(s) have launched to start capturing the clock data streams.
The server and client can be configured to run without LSL by setting the "useLSL" key to `false` in both configuration JSON files.

### Script Dependencies

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
* [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)
* [LabRecorder](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-LabRecorder)

Script for orchestrating the launch of DIARC, ROS and the Unity Space Station environment for experimentation

positional arguments:
  {build,dev,run,stop,kill}
                        Commands to run
    build               Build the DIARC Space Station docker image
    dev                 Run the simulation servers in dev mode

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

```

### Configuration

A `.env` file defines all of the environment variables needed to launch the space station simulation on your machine or network.
It must be created in this project directory and available to all scripts.

Example, also found in default.env:

```
BIN="docker compose"
UNITY_IP="127.0.0.1"
DIARC_CONFIG="edu.tufts.hrilab.config.unity.UnityDIARCSpaceStation"
DIARC_CONFIG_SPOKE="edu.tufts.hrilab.config.unity.UnityDIARCSpaceStationSMMSpoke"
WAIT=20
ROBOTS=1
CLIENTS=1
SMM=false
NETWORK_PREFIX="10.35"
REBUILD=true
EXTRA_ARGS=""
```

Optional but recommended values:

```
LLM_URL="http://127.0.0.1"
LLM_PORT=9900
SERVER="../Space_Station_SMM_Server_3.6.6_Linux"
LSL="~/Documents/CurrentStudy/sub-P001/ses-S001/eeg/sub-P001_ses-S001_task-Default_run-001_eeg.xdf"
SETTINGS="~/server_settings_1.json"
```

#### Required Values


`BIN` is the command that will be used to launch the docker-compose.yaml file that is generated by this script.
If your system requires root to run this command it should be changed to `sudo docker compose`.
If you have installed the `docker-compose` script instead of the plugin, it should be changed to `docker-compose` or `sudo docker-compose` if your system requires root to launch containers.

`UNITY_IP` is the IP address of the machine the Unity server build is running on.
If this is a separate machine from the one running these docker containers it should have the port 1755 is open for network connections.

`DIARC_CONFIG` is the configuration file to launch on startup.
If you are developing your own DIARC configuration, change this value to point to your new class.

`DIARC_CONFIG_SPOKE` is the optional secondary DIARC configuration to run as a spoke.
This is used for secondary robots and in the example provided only starts a TFComponent, MoveBaseComponent and UnityPR2Component for this robot.

`WAIT` is the time, in seconds, between starting up ROS and starting up DIARC during which the Unity server needs to be started.

`ROBOTS` is the number of robots to deploy in the simulation.
Currently the max is 2.

`CLIENTS` is the number of clients expected to connect to the server.
Currently the max is 

`SMM` determines whether DIARC is started in a hub and spoke configuration to allow the robots to share their mental models.
Set to `true` to enable this configuration and ensure that you have a `DIARC_CONFIG_SPOKE` configuration file set.

`NETWORK_PREFIX` is the /16 of the docker compose network to create.
This will ensure that in a multi-robot setup the TRADE containers can freely communicate to known, static IP addresses and not require additional configuration.
The default value "10.35" will work on most systems

`REBUILD` is an optional setting for development branches.
When running `bash usd.sh dev ...` commands, by default the entire branch will be rebuilt on each launch.
Set this to the value `false` to skip this step and launch without rebuilding DIARC.

`EXTRA_ARGS` contains additional arguments that will be passed to the DIARC configuration on launch via gradle's `--args` argument.


#### Optional Values


`LLM_URL` is the base URL of a [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) server hosting a model to be used by DIARC's LLMParserComponent if used in your configuration.

`LLM_PORT` is the starting port number of the `llama.cpp` server.
In the case of a multi robot configuration, multiple servers improve performance and reduce inference time which improves dialog interactions with the robots.

`SERVER` (Linux-only) is the path to the directory containing the Unity server.
This is the location of the Unity server build that will be launched automatically when the simulation is ready to be started.

`LSL` is the location of the `.xdf` file that LabRecorder writes to by default.
This will be the file that is copied into the output directory when a simulation is run.

`SETTINGS` is the location of the `server_settings.json` file to be used with the experiment.
This file (which does not need to be named "server_settings.json" but should be valid JSON and generated by the [DIARC Space Station Simulation Settings Generator](https://hrilabtufts.github.io/DIARC_Space_Station_Simulation_Settings_Generator/)) will be swapped into the Unity server directory before launching.


### Script Commands

Run DIARC and ROS on localhost.
This will start a single container with the diarc configuration.
Robot will connect to `127.0.0.1:1755` on the Unity server and publish a Rosbridge websocket server on port `9090`.

If your docker installation requires root to run, do not run this command with `sudo`, instead update your `.env` file's `BIN` variable to be `sudo docker compose` or `sudo docker-compose` as needed.

This will start and launch associated ROS and DIARC.

```bash
python launch.py run
```

This will start 2 robots and associated ROS and DIARC containers.

```bash
python launch.py -r 2
```

This will start 2 robots in a shared mental model configuration.

```bash
python launch.py -r 2 -s
```

To save all data from a particular session to a directory, use the `-o` or `--output` argument.
The following command will collect all logs from the server and, if configured, the client to a new folder named `subject_001_data` in your home directory.

```bash
python launch.py run -r 1 -o ~/subject_001_data
```

  -e EXTRAARGS, --extraArgs EXTRAARGS
                        Extra arguments supplied to DIARC configuration on launch

```

Run DIARC in dev mode and use a repository which can be edited locally.
This will rebuild the `unity` component in `../diarc` and launch DIARC with debug port `5005` expecting a connection from IntelliJ to start DIARC.
When launching the docker containers the local repo will be volume mapped into the filesystem so your changes will be reflected immediately.
This can be used for rapid development.

```bash
python launch.py dev ../diarc
```

In the case of a two robot setup, you will need two local gradle environments to run them.
Clone diarc to a secondary local repo, such as `diarc2` and run the following command to launch the simulation.

```bash
python launch.py dev -r 2 ../diarc ../diarc2
```

To save all data from a particular session to a directory, use the `-o` or `--output` argument.
The following command will collect all logs from the server and, if configured, the client to a new folder named `subject_001_data` in your home directory.

```bash
python launch.py dev -r 1 -o ~/subject_001_data ..diarc 
```
